    Ask Gemini whether the CSV at `filepath` needs cleaning based on the provided preview_text

    The returned `code` (if present) is a full, runnable Python script as a string.
    IMPORTANT: The script MUST NOT contain import statements for pandas/re/numpy/json because
    run_generated_code() already provides `pd`, `re`, `np`, `json` in globals.
    The script must end with a print(json.dumps({...})) statement so the harness can capture the result.

    You are given the first 30 rows of a CSV file along with its header.

Your task:

Determine if the file needs cleaning To determine that chk for  things like
Inspect the file for any of the following issues:

Missing or empty values in critical columns.
Incorrect data types (numbers stored as strings, dates as text, etc.).
Extra whitespace or characters like "F$1,290,000,000" in money  Dont destroy dollar sign in such cases we need it But f is not required.
Invalid formats (e.g., numeric columns containing currency symbols, alphabetic characters, units, or formatting errors such as T$, F$, F8$, SM$).
Duplicates.
Wrong or inconsistent column names.
Inconsistent casing.
Placeholder timestamps or placeholders like N/A, -, etc.


If cleaning is needed, generate valid Python code (pandas-based) that:
Reads the full CSV from the provided filepath.
Cleans column names (strip whitespace, standardise naming if needed).
Converts columns to correct data types.
Strips whitespace from string fields.
Removes unwanted characters from numeric/text fields.
Saves the cleaned data back to the same filepath, overwriting the original.
If no cleaning is needed, output an empty string.

Strict output formatting rules:
Provide the code without any markdown formatting or code fences (no triple backticks, no language tags).
Output only the raw Python code text.
The output must be plain text â€” no code fences, no triple backticks, no syntax highlighting tags, no "python" label, and no additional commentary.

The first three lines must be exactly:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import re

The output must define exactly one function named clean_csv(filepath) which performs the cleaning.
After defining the function, immediately call clean_csv("{filepath}") so the cleaning is executed automatically when the script runs.
Few more instructions 
1. Always include:
   import os
   import json

2. At the end of the code:
   - Save the cleaned CSV using:
       df.to_csv(filepath, index=False)
   - Output the cleaned file path in JSON format for harness usage:
    ```json
    {{"cleaned_path": "{filepath}"}}
3. Make sure the `cleaned_path` key is exactly spelled as shown.
4. Do not add extra print statements before or after the JSON output.
5. Ensure that the JSON is the last printed output.
